### Slide 1: Introduction
**Title:** Monotonic ID Generation in PySpark

**Content:**
Comparing the behavior of the `monotonically_increasing_id()` function in PySpark when running in local mode versus cluster mode with multiple executors.

### Slide 2: PySpark Job Example
**Title:** Adding Monotonic IDs to DataFrame

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import monotonically_increasing_id

# Main function to execute the job
def main():
    # Creating a Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Monotonic ID Example").getOrCreate()

    # Creating a DataFrame
    data = spark.createDataFrame([("Alice", "HR"), ("Bob", "Engineering"), 
                                  ("Charlie", "Marketing"), ("David", "Sales")], 
                                 ["name", "department"])

    # Adding monotonic IDs to each row
    data_with_id = data.withColumn("id", monotonically_increasing_id())
    data_with_id.show()

# Running the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Note:**
Code to add a monotonic ID to each row of a DataFrame in PySpark.

### Slide 3: Local Mode Execution
**Title:** Local Mode Results

**Command:**
```sh
spark-submit --master local[1] main.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```sh
+--------+-----------+---+
|    name| department| id|
+--------+-----------+---+
|   Alice|         HR|  0|
|     Bob|Engineering|  1|
| Charlie| Marketing |  2|
|   David|      Sales|  3|
+--------+-----------+---+
```

**Note:**
In local mode, IDs are generated sequentially as there's only a single executor.

---

### Slide 4: Cluster Mode Execution
**Title:** Cluster Mode Results

**Command:**
(Replace `<master-url>` with your cluster's master URL)
```sh
spark-submit --master <master-url> --num-executors 3 main.py
```

**Possible Output:**
```sh
+--------+-----------+---+
|    name| department| id|
+--------+-----------+---+
|   Alice|         HR|  0|
|     Bob|Engineering|  1|
| Charlie| Marketing |  8|
|   David|      Sales|  9|
+--------+-----------+---+
```

**Note:**
In cluster mode with multiple executors, IDs might not be sequential due to concurrent operations on different partitions.

---

### Slide 5: Key Takeaways
**Title:** Observations and Insights

**Content:**
1. In **Local Mode**, the `monotonically_increasing_id()` function generates sequential IDs because of a single executor.
2. In **Cluster Mode** with multiple executors, the IDs can be non-sequential. Each partition may generate IDs concurrently.
3. It's essential to test ID generation behavior in the intended execution environment to understand and validate outcomes effectively.

**Closing Note:**
Always consider the execution environment (local or cluster) to ensure accurate testing and predictable behavior of ID generation in PySpark applications.
